        "Fiscal Year2015: No accomplishments to report with this year's funding since the incremental funding was awarded in late FFY2015.  See the list of accomplishments under Section 130 for FY2015. Fiscal Year2016: No accomplishments to report with this year's funding since the incremental funding was awarded in late FFY2015 Fiscal Year2018: Here is a partial list of some examples of projects funded: Nearly 1,000 acres of harvestable shellfish beds have been reopened since January 2017. 760 acres of commercial shellfish beds have been upgraded in Liberty Bay. Kitsap County teamed up with local stakeholders to apply progressive pollution identification and correction strategies. \u2022 Stormwater Strategic Initiative \u2022 The University of Washington Tacoma's \"Stormwater Chemical Characterization and Watershed Prioritization\" surveyed stormwater in Puget Sound creeks to identify sources, watersheds, and time periods that are responsible for disproportionate water quality degradation and should be prioritized for restoration or stormwater treatment efforts. UW Center for Urban Waters researchers collected >140 water samples in 15 Puget Sound creeks during storm events in Fall 2017 \u2013 Spring 2019. Using advanced chemical analyses, they: 1) prioritized regional watersheds most impacted by urban runoff, 2) identified chemical indicators for urbanization and biological degradation, and 3) characterized \"pollutographs\" relative to storm hydrographs, to measure and prioritize contaminant flows in urban creeks affected by stormwater pollution. In collaboration with Miller Creek Basin (Cities of Burien, Normandy Park, and SeaTac; Port of Seattle; King County) partners, they sampled along the watershed to identify key contaminant inputs and polluted reaches of the creek. Findings will guide efforts to treat urban stormwater and improve water quality for coho salmon based on these findings. Several recent journal publications were informed by this NEP-funded research, including \"Using High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry to Identify Organic Contaminants Linked to Urban Stormwater Mortality Syndrome in Coho Salmon\" in Environmental Science and Technology. This publication indicated that tire wear particle leachates contribute to coho pre-spawn mortality. 129 acres of Birth Bay in Whatcom County have been upgraded to allow year-round shellfish harvest by both recreational and commercial fishers. From 2007 through January 2018 a total of 11, 318 acres were upgraded and 6,298 acres were downgraded for a net total of 5,020 acres of improvement. Pollution and Identification and Correction (PIC) programs help counties respond to downgrades by forming shellfish protection districts and developing closure response plans to identify and correct pollution sources in areas with declining water quality. The counties\u2019 Local Health jurisdictions have been able to change landowner behavior using incentives like rebates for inspections, pump outs, and installation of risers. Farm incentives are being used to  install best management practices such as fencing, gutters, and covered manure storage. 2,578 acres of habitat have been restored or permanently protected. In Snohomish county 27 shoreline restoration program are completed \u2013 helping to restore 2,200 linear feet of shoreline. Also, many lake landowners have participated in the LakeWise program (lawn or septic care workshop and/or site visit). This program can reduce nutrient pollution at threatened lakes through actions of the residents, Starter package content for the Toxics in Fish report is complete and delivered. Since 2017 the program has made significant progress in implementing a new and improved funding model, finalizing four additional implementation strategies for the Floodplains, Land Development and Cover, Chinook Salmon, and Shoreline Armoring vital signs. A template for Implementation Strategy fact sheets was developed. A Draft Implementation Strategy Communication Strategy was completed and updated as a living document. Update of economic vital sign indicators. The 2017 State of the Sound report was completed and published online in November 2017, on schedule. The substantially redesigned 2017 State of the Sound report, was recently nominated for the National Conference of State Legislatures\u2019 2018 Notable Document Award. 2018 Puget Sound Action Agenda Update: Near Term Action (NTA) coordination and collaboration occurred from November 2017 with issuance of the Final NTA Solicitation through Reviewer Evaluations that continued from March-July 2018. Over 80 people from around Puget Sound gathered for two days to review and evaluate over 600 actions proposed for consideration in the Puget Sound Action Agenda. The 2016 Action Agenda was adopted, and now the draft 2018 Puget Sound Action Agenda is being released for public comment on September 1, 2018. The Management Conference review and Leadership action are anticipated for December 2018 after which the document will be submitted to EPA for approval. State agency leadership, Board members and Leadership Council member helped to organize and participated in the 2018 Salish Sea Ecosystem Conference. The backbone Puget Sound organization uses many communication approaches to interact with hundreds of organizations and individuals across Puget Sound. Our partners are geographically dispersed and connect with their own networks to implement recovery actions, yet all share a common vision of a healthy Puget Sound. The lead organization uses a collective impact model because it seeks to bring people together, in a structured way, to achieve change. The role of a backbone organization for regional recovery is to orchestrate the work of regional partners and ideally help to maximize the outcomes they achieve. They in helping to promote excellence in communication, engagement and building trust, developed a Strategic Communication Plan which includes goals to ensure that key decision-makers have the tools, information, and support to make policy and funding decisions that will accelerate Puget Sound recovery and to engage partners in the collective impact community to build trust, reinforce relationships, and foster commitments .Fiscal Year2020: Listed below are some examples of funded projects from the three Strategic Initiative Lead grants, the Puget Sound base grant and the science/implementation strategy grant. **The Hood Canal community upgraded 66 acres of the Hood Canal 6 Shellfish Growing Area around Hoodsport. **Skagit County\u2019s work using Microbial Source Tracking has succeeded in finding and fixing three significant pollution problems in their Pollution Identification and Correction (PIC) areas. A dairy and a small cattle farmer have both located and fixed problems including crushed drainage pipes and repairing and setting back fencing. A septic system that had previously been cleared by a dye test was also confirmed to be a source during high groundwater levels, and the Skagit County Health Department is following up with the owner. After finding dog poop markers at all sites, they have also created a renewed emphasis on cleaning up dog poop in yards in our PoopSmart campaign. **Urban stormwater runoff has become the foremost water quality threat to aquatic habitats in Puget Sound. Human population growth continues to drive development and land conversion in coastal watersheds. Increased development reduces opportunity for water to filter through vegetation and soils, increasing the loading of toxic chemicals in stormwater runoff and into Puget Sound. This can have extensive negative impacts on the health and survival of salmon, as well as the levels of contaminants in both freshwater and marine food webs. EPA-supported collaborative research on stormwater and toxics reduction strategies have shown that: ? Motor vehicles are major sources of toxic contaminants in roadway runoff routinely discharged to streams, rivers, lakes, and nearshore marine habitats; \u2022 There are thousands of distinct chemicals in urban stormwater, and the toxicological impacts of most remain poorly understood; ? Coho salmon are sensitive to untreated stormwater, which consistently causes mass mortality events that vary in severity across a gradient of urbanization in Puget Sound; ? The urban mortality syndrome poses a threat to other threatened salmonid species, including Puget Sound steelhead; ? Toxic threats to aquatic habitats scale in proportion to pavement and other impervious surfaces within large watersheds (e.g., the Snohomish River Basin), a basis for prioritizing green infrastructure mitigation efforts; ? Common petroleum-derived compounds in stormwater are also found in crude oil (e.g., the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill) and cause nearly identical developmental defects in the embryos of herring and other shore-spawning marine forage fish; ? Conventional green infrastructure methods involving bio-infiltration effectively remove pollutants and reduce or eliminate toxic impacts to salmon, forage fish, and invertebrates. **Washington State Dairy Nutrient Management Program: 12 Best Management Practices (BMPs) implemented after technical assistance and noted at inspection. 3 BMP's implemented after some type of regulatory action such as warning letters. 8 referrals to local conservation district to assist with BMP's or financial assistance. ** Skagit Public Works Pollution Identification and Correction (PIC): There has been a major success with a small commercial livestock producer during 2020. After water quality samples showed high level of fecal coliform last year, a commercial cattle ranch worked with Skagit Conservation District to fix the impairment identified. Follow up sampling shows that the fix has reduced runoff to almost nothing. It was a quick turnaround time from issue identified to issued corrected. **WSU Pasture Management: Held two virtual workshop series to address pasture and livestock management practices, reaching 747 participants. Workshops were recorded and will be made publicly available for ongoing outreach. **The Toxics in Fish Implementation Strategy Narrative outlines a recovery plan that is focused on reducing the levels and impacts of contaminants on Puget Sound aquatic life and the people who consume them. It includes a series of strategies that will prevent, mitigate, and cleanup toxics in aquatic life throughout Puget Sound. This will be the Puget Sound community\u2019s roadmap to recovery \u2013 it\u2019s the regional plan to get toxics out of aquatic food webs. **With the guidance of the advisory team, the Stormwater Strategic Initiative Lead has also been able to explore developing a cross-cutting strategy to address various threats from transportation--including road runoff, transportation planning and land use, and retrofitting for water quality and fish passage. **The Stormwater Strategic Initiative Lead has written blog posts, and to communicate our work in a way that helps make the Implementation Strategies more accessible and approachable. **The Habitat Implementation Strategies Update Workplan for 2020-2021 was successfully implemented to develop a draft update of each Implementation Strategy narrative. **With the awardee\u2019s Communications Lead's efforts, the Habitat Strategic Initiative Lead blog has increased the frequency of communications and the standardization of the work. They hosted several close-out webinars for subaward grants including the Shoreline Residential Revolving Loan Fund Feasibility Study and the Model Volunteer Program for Oil Spill Response / Assessment. **The Habitat Strategic Initiative Lead has been exploring a Shared Investment Pilot to leverage investments in shared regional and local priority activities. They have been actively engaged in 2022-2026 Action Agenda development. **Puget Sound agencies report on 52 Puget Sound Vital Sign indicators. 31 of which are associated with 2020 ecosystem recovery targets. Each indicator is evaluated for progress (change relative to a point back in time) and status (whether or not they meet their 2020 targets). **On April 6, 2021, the PS Leadership Council approved a set of desired outcomes for the 2022-2026 Action Agenda. **The Salish Sea Ecosystem Conference brings together scientists, First Nations and tribal government rep-resentatives, resource managers, community and business leaders, knowledge holders and policy makers. The 2020 conference was held virtually. The conference has become the become the premier scientific re-search and policy gathering in the Pacific Northwest. The presentations and discussions that occur at the Salish Sea Ecosystem Conference are a platform to build shared policies, practices, and procedures neces-sary to guide future actions for protecting and restoring the Salish Sea and its watersheds. The outcome is improved scientific collaboration, data sharing and dynamic discussions and on the state of the Salish Sea ecosystem. **The State of Knowledge Report and the Base Program Analysis for the B-IBI Implementation Strategy were completed. **The Toxics in Fish research and monitoring priorities have been incorporated into the Implementation Strategy. **The Human Dimensions protocol has been adaptively managed, which includes updates, revisions, con-nections to Human Well Being Vital Sign data and academic literature, and a redesign. Protocol content has been integrated into Implementation Strategies, specifically Land Development and Cover and Marine Water Quality. Major success was co-creation of many Implementation Strategy social science products. **Five magazine-style articles about science-related findings from the 2020 Salish Sea Ecosystem Conference have been completed. Four newsletters were published (12/19/20, 4/17/20, 6/30/20 and 9/28/20) that described the University of Washington Puget Sound Institute and other Puget Sound-recovery-related events and information. The Toxics in Fish Implementation Strategy fact sheet was completed. Ongoing, regular blogs and social media posts were completed. Ten magazine-style features and 10 shorter articles about Implementation Strategies and Vital Signs were completed. The Encyclopedia of Puget Sound has continually been updated and provides an indexed and searchable place for technical and supporting documents. An updated communication strategy of Implementation Strategy showing targeted audiences, timelines, and distribution channels has been completed. **A Critical Analysis focused on refining an indicator for the Summer Stream Flows Vital Sign, was completed. A Critical Analysis focused on an evaluation of Stormwater Utility Fees in the Puget Sound watershed was completed.Fiscal Year2022: Projects under this assistance listing implement the 2022-2026 Action Agenda which charts the course for Puget Sound recovery as the Puget Sound community\u2019s shared plan for advancing protection and restoration efforts across the region like developing and finalizing implementation strategies; releasing a report on 6PPD, prioritizing coastal streams and embayments along Puget Sound with the railroad company for fish passage and stream restoration activities; and collecting storm data in a watershed to tell the county where it should focus its efforts.

They in helping to promote excellence in communication, engagement and building trust, developed a Strategic Communication Plan which includes goals to ensure that key decision-makers have the tools, information, and support to make policy and funding decisions that will accelerate Puget Sound recovery and to engage partners in the collective impact community to build trust, reinforce relationships, and foster commitments .Fiscal Year2020: Listed below are some examples of funded projects from the three Strategic Initiative Lead grants, the Puget Sound base grant and the science/implementation strategy grant. **The Hood Canal community upgraded 66 acres of the Hood Canal 6 Shellfish Growing Area around Hoodsport. **Skagit County\u2019s work using Microbial Source Tracking has succeeded in finding and fixing three significant pollution problems in their Pollution Identification and Correction (PIC) areas. A dairy and a small cattle farmer have both located and fixed problems including crushed drainage pipes and repairing and setting back fencing. A septic system that had previously been cleared by a dye test was also confirmed to be a source during high groundwater levels, and the Skagit County Health Department is following up with the owner. After finding dog poop markers at all sites, they have also created a renewed emphasis on cleaning up dog poop in yards in our PoopSmart campaign. **Urban stormwater runoff has become the foremost water quality threat to aquatic habitats in Puget Sound. Human population growth continues to drive development and land conversion in coastal watersheds. Increased development reduces opportunity for water to filter through vegetation and soils, increasing the loading of toxic chemicals in stormwater runoff and into Puget Sound. This can have extensive negative impacts on the health and survival of salmon, as well as the levels of contaminants in both freshwater and marine food webs. EPA-supported collaborative research on stormwater and toxics reduction strategies have shown that: ? Motor vehicles are major sources of toxic contaminants in roadway runoff routinely discharged to streams, rivers, lakes, and nearshore marine habitats; \u2022 There are thousands of distinct chemicals in urban stormwater, and the toxicological impacts of most remain poorly understood; ? Coho salmon are sensitive to untreated stormwater, which consistently causes mass mortality events that vary in severity across a gradient of urbanization in Puget Sound; ? The urban mortality syndrome poses a threat to other threatened salmonid species, including Puget Sound steelhead; ? Toxic threats to aquatic habitats scale in proportion to pavement and other impervious surfaces within large watersheds (e.g., the Snohomish River Basin), a basis for prioritizing green infrastructure mitigation efforts; ? Common petroleum-derived compounds in stormwater are also found in crude oil (e.g., the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill) and cause nearly identical developmental defects in the embryos of herring and other shore-spawning marine forage fish; ? Conventional green infrastructure methods involving bio-infiltration effectively remove pollutants and reduce or eliminate toxic impacts to salmon, forage fish, and invertebrates. **Washington State Dairy Nutrient Management Program: 12 Best Management Practices (BMPs) implemented after technical assistance and noted at inspection. 3 BMP's implemented after some type of regulatory action such as warning letters. 8 referrals to local conservation district to assist with BMP's or financial assistance. ** Skagit Public Works Pollution Identification and Correction (PIC): There has been a major success with a small commercial livestock producer during 2020. After water quality samples showed high level of fecal coliform last year, a commercial cattle ranch worked with Skagit Conservation District to fix the impairment identified. Follow up sampling shows that the fix has reduced runoff to almost nothing. It was a quick turnaround time from issue identified to issued corrected. **WSU Pasture Management: Held two virtual workshop series to address pasture and livestock management practices, reaching 747 participants. Workshops were recorded and will be made publicly available for ongoing outreach. **The Toxics in Fish Implementation Strategy Narrative outlines a recovery plan that is focused on reducing the levels and impacts of contaminants on Puget Sound aquatic life and the people who consume them. It includes a series of strategies that will prevent, mitigate, and cleanup toxics in aquatic life throughout Puget Sound. This will be the Puget Sound community\u2019s roadmap to recovery \u2013 it\u2019s the regional plan to get toxics out of aquatic food webs. **With the guidance of the advisory team, the Stormwater Strategic Initiative Lead has also been able to explore developing a cross-cutting strategy to address various threats from transportation--including road runoff, transportation planning and land use, and retrofitting for water quality and fish passage. **The Stormwater Strategic Initiative Lead has written blog posts, and to communicate our work in a way that helps make the Implementation Strategies more accessible and approachable. **The Habitat Implementation Strategies Update Workplan for 2020-2021 was successfully implemented to develop a draft update of each Implementation Strategy narrative. **With the awardee\u2019s Communications Lead's efforts, the Habitat Strategic Initiative Lead blog has increased the frequency of communications and the standardization of the work. They hosted several close-out webinars for subaward grants including the Shoreline Residential Revolving Loan Fund Feasibility Study and the Model Volunteer Program for Oil Spill Response / Assessment. **The Habitat Strategic Initiative Lead has been exploring a Shared Investment Pilot to leverage investments in shared regional and local priority activities. They have been actively engaged in 2022-2026 Action Agenda development. **Puget Sound agencies report on 52 Puget Sound Vital Sign indicators. 31 of which are associated with 2020 ecosystem recovery targets. Each indicator is evaluated for progress (change relative to a point back in time) and status (whether or not they meet their 2020 targets). **On April 6, 2021, the PS Leadership Council approved a set of desired outcomes for the 2022-2026 Action Agenda. **The Salish Sea Ecosystem Conference brings together scientists, First Nations and tribal government rep-resentatives, resource managers, community and business leaders, knowledge holders and policy makers. The 2020 conference was held virtually. The conference has become the become the premier scientific re-search and policy gathering in the Pacific Northwest. The presentations and discussions that occur at the Salish Sea Ecosystem Conference are a platform to build shared policies, practices, and procedures neces-sary to guide future actions for protecting and restoring the Salish Sea and its watersheds. The outcome is improved scientific collaboration, data sharing and dynamic discussions and on the state of the Salish Sea ecosystem. **The State of Knowledge Report and the Base Program Analysis for the B-IBI Implementation Strategy were completed. **The Toxics in Fish research and monitoring priorities have been incorporated into the Implementation Strategy. **The Human Dimensions protocol has been adaptively managed, which includes updates, revisions, con-nections to Human Well Being Vital Sign data and academic literature, and a redesign. Protocol content has been integrated into Implementation Strategies, specifically Land Development and Cover and Marine Water Quality. Major success was co-creation of many Implementation Strategy social science products. **Five magazine-style articles about science-related findings from the 2020 Salish Sea Ecosystem Conference have been completed. Four newsletters were published (12/19/20, 4/17/20, 6/30/20 and 9/28/20) that described the University of Washington Puget Sound Institute and other Puget Sound-recovery-related events and information. The Toxics in Fish Implementation Strategy fact sheet was completed. Ongoing, regular blogs and social media posts were completed. Ten magazine-style features and 10 shorter articles about Implementation Strategies and Vital Signs were completed. The Encyclopedia of Puget Sound has continually been updated and provides an indexed and searchable place for technical and supporting documents. An updated communication strategy of Implementation Strategy showing targeted audiences, timelines, and distribution channels has been completed. **A Critical Analysis focused on refining an indicator for the Summer Stream Flows Vital Sign, was completed. A Critical Analysis focused on an evaluation of Stormwater Utility Fees in the Puget Sound watershed was completed.Fiscal Year2022: Projects under this assistance listing implement the 2022-2026 Action Agenda which charts the course for Puget Sound recovery as the Puget Sound community\u2019s shared plan for advancing protection and restoration efforts across the region like developing and finalizing implementation strategies; releasing a report on 6PPD, prioritizing coastal streams and embayments along Puget Sound with the railroad company for fish passage and stream restoration activities; and collecting storm data in a watershed to tell the county where it should focus its efforts.

Research consistently indicates that living in poverty, unemployment, inadequate housing and conflict between parents are stressors that interfere with a parent\u2019s ability to effectively raise children.    \r\n\r\nThe results/outcomes of the training is as follows:   95 % of parents increased knowledge in understanding child development, 90 % of parents increased knowledge of effective parenting practices; 97 % of parents increased knowledge in nurturing children 95% of parents increased knowledge in guiding children. Practice outcomes: 93 % of parents have adopted practices in guiding children; 95 % of parents will use community resources to meet their needs; 97% of parents adopted practices to reduce family conflict and manage stress.\r\n\r\nSocial and Economic Opportunity:\r\nSmall Farm Program is an Extension program designed to help farm families with decision-making skills to solve farm and home problems. One of the goals of the Small Farm Program is to focus on developing a sub-wholesale system that will readily provide nutrient-dense foods of high quality and reduced price to the communities.  \r\n\r\nFood Systems and Food Safety\r\n\r\nHistorically Disadvantaged Farmers Go Commercial-The Institution helped a group of farmers to: form the Small Farmer Agricultural Cooperative; negotiate agreements with Wal-Mart and each other, and obtain production equipment and supplies and wells, access to transportation and refrigeration units, and training and technical assistance on commercial-level harvesting and grading, packing and processing, food safety, integrated pest management, and record keeping.  \r\n\r\nAgricultural Production and Processing:\r\n\r\nDetection of diseases in farmed raised fish is not as readily visible as in other terrestrial livestock species. Fish are raised in aquatic environments and are not easily visible to the farmer. Proper diagnosis of fish diseases prevents catastrophic losses to the producer. Healthy fish used as foodfish, baitfish, or for stocking waters for recreational fishing ensures the safety of seafood for human consumption and prevents the spread of diseases to other aquatic systems. The Institution\u2019s Fish Health Inspection labs conducts routine health inspections; issues health certificates for fish being shipped to other states and countries, conducts inspections for the baitfish certification program, analyzes water quality, and identifies aquatic weeds.  In 2017, personnel at the labs conducted 342 disease diagnostic cases (1670 fish total and 414 water quality/aquatic weed identification cases).\r\n\r\n(E) & (EE) - Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (aka EFNEP) and EFNEP WebNEERS (Competitive)\r\n\r\nFISCAL YEAR (FY) 2017:\r\n\r\nThe Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) is funded as a national program, not as individual projects.

These funds supported a total of 73 1862, 1890, and insular land-grant universities.\r\n\r\nExamples of project impacts include:\r\n\r\n1.\tYour Land, Your Legacy: Deciding the Future of My Land - Land is probably one of the most valuable assets a landowner has. Deciding what will happen to the land after the owner is gone is a critical step in land stewardship.  \r\n2.\tKentucky Forest Sector Economic Contribution - Forests cover nearly half the state of Kentucky and are the foundation of a forest sector that is a major economic force in the Commonwealth and as of 2016, account for $13.92 billion in total economic contributions. \r\n3.\tOregon Citizen Fire Academy - Oregon Citizen Fire Academy is a collaborative education and service program designed to increase the outreach capacity of fire agencies and, ultimately, to maintain and enhance fire-adapted communities. \r\n4.\tHeirs Property - Land loss among limited resource and minority landowners has increased dramatically over recent years and continues to impact the ability to generate income and sustain their ownerships. One of the most serious problems is that of heir property, where land has been passed down through generations with little if any documentation of ownership.  \r\n5.\tReading the Range - Reading the Range is a collaborative program involving ranchers, range Extension Specialists, and agency personnel that aims to increase rangeland monitoring as a standard operating procedure on ranches by providing examples, called demonstration ranches, and technical assistance.\r\n\r\n(P) Rural Health and Safety (aka Rural Health & Safety Education)\r\n\r\nRHSE projects funded in FY 2017 focused on chronic disease prevention and management and the prevention and reduction of opioid misuse and abuse. A few examples are as follows:\r\n\r\nUniversity Extension Engaged to Raise Awareness and Prevent Opioid Misuse Before It Starts:\r\n\r\nA USDA-funded grant with State Extension Service, Preventing Opioid Misuse and Abuse in the SouthEast (PROMISE) Initiative, is integrating an upstream, multi-phased approach to promoting prescription opioid misuse prevention including: \r\n(1) Community engagement forums to assess the perceived needs and readiness of community for education on this topic; \r\n(2) Extension agent-led and peer-to-peer education; \r\n(3) a social marketing campaign; and \r\n(4) placement of prescription drug take-back boxes throughout the community. \r\n\r\nNearly half the state is categorized as rural. Therefore, the target population of the PROMISE Initiative is rural residents. The PROMISE Initiative is currently in phase one of the project, conducting community engagement forums in three high-risk and rural counties. \r\n\r\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Interventions to Prevent Opioid Abuse and Misuse in a Rural State:\r\n\r\nOpioids are commonly prescribed for chronic pain sufferers, but new CDC guidelines recommend against opioids as the first course of treatment for chronic pain. Instead, CDC advises that non-drug strategies such as muscle strengthening exercise, yoga, and cognitive-behavioral self-management may be more effective long-term. However, these approaches may do little to help rural residents with chronic pain because of extremely limited or nonexistent access to programs and services. Cognitive-behavioral approaches, such as chronic pain self-management programs, are often unavailable in rural counties; access to fitness facilities, classes, and knowledgeable instructors is likewise extremely constrained. \r\n\r\nExpanding The Evidence-Based Prosper Delivery System to Address the Opioid Epidemic:\r\n\r\nState University\u2019s Partnerships in Prevention Science Institute, in collaboration with Extension and Outreach, is working to become part of the solution to the opioid epidemic in rural Iowa communities. The USDA\u2019s National Institute on Food and Agriculture is funding the PROSPER Rx project, the goal of which is to reduce prescription opioid demand and availability. This work is being accomplished through community-based teams led by Extension educators in three counties that are delivering evidence-based programming for youth and families, engaging in broad-based awareness-building activities, and coordinating with rural healthcare providers and law enforcement to distribute educational materials promoting safe medication storage and disposal. \r\n\r\nPreventing Opioid Abuse in a Rural State:\r\n\r\nA multi-disciplinary team assembled in 2017 and is working through a USDA-NIFA Rural Health and Safety Education Grant to prevent opioid abuse in rural parts of the state using a two-pronged approach. The first approach is targeting youth and families through the PROmoting School-community-university Partnerships to Enhance Resilience (PROSPER) evidence-based model developed by Iowa State and Pennsylvania State Universities to prevent alcohol and drug abuse in youth. Through this model, community teams are developed to oversee implementation of family and school-based interventions. For this project the family-based intervention being used is Strengthening Families 10-14, while Botvin Life Skills Training is being provided to youth in the schools. \r\n\r\nEmpowering Youth and Families:\r\n\r\nState University is stepping up to the challenge to prevent opioid misuse in rural communities in the state. Through a grant from USDA\u2019s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, the  State 4-H Empowering Youth and Families Program together with the State Office of Rural Health, are working to empower families and communities in three rural counties. Families with youth ages 10-14 meet weekly to participate in educational sessions that provide age-appropriate research- and evidence-based training in the art of family building and the impact of opioid misuse. They are given the opportunity to practice their new skills and behaviors. \r\n\r\n(Q) 1890 Facilities Grant Program (aka Section 1447 Grants)\r\n\r\nFiscal Year (FY) 2017:\r\n\r\n1890 Facilities Grant Program:\r\n\r\nFunds were used to continue improvements in instructional, research, and extension facilities, by dedicating funds to construct an access road to the Agricultural Experiment Station.  The new road improves travel to and from the facility which is used by research, extension and education faculty, community partners, and visitors.  Efforts put forth under this initiative ensures adequate safety of users, durability of vehicles and other equipment traveling on the access road to protect lives.  \r\n\r\n1890 Facilities Grant Proposal (FY 2017):\r\n\r\nThe Institution established and equipped two new greenhouses that support research and extension activities, installed a 40x40 square foot shade house adjacent to the greenhouses, and purchased and installed three high tunnels in the field near the greenhouse area.\r\n\r\nEnhancement of Teaching, Research and Extension Facilities \u2013 2017:\r\n\r\nFunds were used to continue with the construction of a Complex for Urban and Sustainable Agriculture, Food, Education and Research Building and the establishment of a Community Garden and Student Farm.  Both initiatives will be engaged in education, research, extension, and community outreach activities.  The focal point will be sustainable agriculture and urban, local, and community food systems education for producers, consumers, and students.  \r\n\r\nFacilities Grant Program \u2013 FY 2017:\r\n\r\nFacilities funds were used to: \r\n1) complete the relocation of an Agricultural and Environmental Research Station to the newly identified and improved site (former rehabilitation center); \r\n2 finalize the renovation of the F.

One of the goals of the Small Farm Program is to focus on developing a sub-wholesale system that will readily provide nutrient-dense foods of high quality and reduced price to the communities.  \r\n\r\nFood Systems and Food Safety\r\n\r\nHistorically Disadvantaged Farmers Go Commercial-The Institution helped a group of farmers to: form the Small Farmer Agricultural Cooperative; negotiate agreements with Wal-Mart and each other, and obtain production equipment and supplies and wells, access to transportation and refrigeration units, and training and technical assistance on commercial-level harvesting and grading, packing and processing, food safety, integrated pest management, and record keeping.  \r\n\r\nAgricultural Production and Processing:\r\n\r\nDetection of diseases in farmed raised fish is not as readily visible as in other terrestrial livestock species. Fish are raised in aquatic environments and are not easily visible to the farmer. Proper diagnosis of fish diseases prevents catastrophic losses to the producer. Healthy fish used as foodfish, baitfish, or for stocking waters for recreational fishing ensures the safety of seafood for human consumption and prevents the spread of diseases to other aquatic systems. The Institution\u2019s Fish Health Inspection labs conducts routine health inspections; issues health certificates for fish being shipped to other states and countries, conducts inspections for the baitfish certification program, analyzes water quality, and identifies aquatic weeds.  In 2017, personnel at the labs conducted 342 disease diagnostic cases (1670 fish total and 414 water quality/aquatic weed identification cases).\r\n\r\n(E) & (EE) - Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (aka EFNEP) and EFNEP WebNEERS (Competitive)\r\n\r\nFISCAL YEAR (FY) 2017:\r\n\r\nThe Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) is funded as a national program, not as individual projects.

These funds supported a total of 73 1862, 1890, and insular land-grant universities.\r\n\r\nExamples of project impacts include:\r\n\r\n1.\tYour Land, Your Legacy: Deciding the Future of My Land - Land is probably one of the most valuable assets a landowner has. Deciding what will happen to the land after the owner is gone is a critical step in land stewardship.  \r\n2.\tKentucky Forest Sector Economic Contribution - Forests cover nearly half the state of Kentucky and are the foundation of a forest sector that is a major economic force in the Commonwealth and as of 2016, account for $13.92 billion in total economic contributions. \r\n3.\tOregon Citizen Fire Academy - Oregon Citizen Fire Academy is a collaborative education and service program designed to increase the outreach capacity of fire agencies and, ultimately, to maintain and enhance fire-adapted communities. \r\n4.\tHeirs Property - Land loss among limited resource and minority landowners has increased dramatically over recent years and continues to impact the ability to generate income and sustain their ownerships. One of the most serious problems is that of heir property, where land has been passed down through generations with little if any documentation of ownership.  \r\n5.\tReading the Range - Reading the Range is a collaborative program involving ranchers, range Extension Specialists, and agency personnel that aims to increase rangeland monitoring as a standard operating procedure on ranches by providing examples, called demonstration ranches, and technical assistance.\r\n\r\n(P) Rural Health and Safety (aka Rural Health & Safety Education)\r\n\r\nRHSE projects funded in FY 2017 focused on chronic disease prevention and management and the prevention and reduction of opioid misuse and abuse. A few examples are as follows:\r\n\r\nUniversity Extension Engaged to Raise Awareness and Prevent Opioid Misuse Before It Starts:\r\n\r\nA USDA-funded grant with State Extension Service, Preventing Opioid Misuse and Abuse in the SouthEast (PROMISE) Initiative, is integrating an upstream, multi-phased approach to promoting prescription opioid misuse prevention including: \r\n(1) Community engagement forums to assess the perceived needs and readiness of community for education on this topic; \r\n(2) Extension agent-led and peer-to-peer education; \r\n(3) a social marketing campaign; and \r\n(4) placement of prescription drug take-back boxes throughout the community. \r\n\r\nNearly half the state is categorized as rural. Therefore, the target population of the PROMISE Initiative is rural residents. The PROMISE Initiative is currently in phase one of the project, conducting community engagement forums in three high-risk and rural counties. \r\n\r\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Interventions to Prevent Opioid Abuse and Misuse in a Rural State:\r\n\r\nOpioids are commonly prescribed for chronic pain sufferers, but new CDC guidelines recommend against opioids as the first course of treatment for chronic pain. Instead, CDC advises that non-drug strategies such as muscle strengthening exercise, yoga, and cognitive-behavioral self-management may be more effective long-term. However, these approaches may do little to help rural residents with chronic pain because of extremely limited or nonexistent access to programs and services. Cognitive-behavioral approaches, such as chronic pain self-management programs, are often unavailable in rural counties; access to fitness facilities, classes, and knowledgeable instructors is likewise extremely constrained. \r\n\r\nExpanding The Evidence-Based Prosper Delivery System to Address the Opioid Epidemic:\r\n\r\nState University\u2019s Partnerships in Prevention Science Institute, in collaboration with Extension and Outreach, is working to become part of the solution to the opioid epidemic in rural Iowa communities. The USDA\u2019s National Institute on Food and Agriculture is funding the PROSPER Rx project, the goal of which is to reduce prescription opioid demand and availability. This work is being accomplished through community-based teams led by Extension educators in three counties that are delivering evidence-based programming for youth and families, engaging in broad-based awareness-building activities, and coordinating with rural healthcare providers and law enforcement to distribute educational materials promoting safe medication storage and disposal. \r\n\r\nPreventing Opioid Abuse in a Rural State:\r\n\r\nA multi-disciplinary team assembled in 2017 and is working through a USDA-NIFA Rural Health and Safety Education Grant to prevent opioid abuse in rural parts of the state using a two-pronged approach. The first approach is targeting youth and families through the PROmoting School-community-university Partnerships to Enhance Resilience (PROSPER) evidence-based model developed by Iowa State and Pennsylvania State Universities to prevent alcohol and drug abuse in youth. Through this model, community teams are developed to oversee implementation of family and school-based interventions. For this project the family-based intervention being used is Strengthening Families 10-14, while Botvin Life Skills Training is being provided to youth in the schools. \r\n\r\nEmpowering Youth and Families:\r\n\r\nState University is stepping up to the challenge to prevent opioid misuse in rural communities in the state. Through a grant from USDA\u2019s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, the  State 4-H Empowering Youth and Families Program together with the State Office of Rural Health, are working to empower families and communities in three rural counties. Families with youth ages 10-14 meet weekly to participate in educational sessions that provide age-appropriate research- and evidence-based training in the art of family building and the impact of opioid misuse. They are given the opportunity to practice their new skills and behaviors. \r\n\r\n(Q) 1890 Facilities Grant Program (aka Section 1447 Grants)\r\n\r\nFiscal Year (FY) 2017:\r\n\r\n1890 Facilities Grant Program:\r\n\r\nFunds were used to continue improvements in instructional, research, and extension facilities, by dedicating funds to construct an access road to the Agricultural Experiment Station.  The new road improves travel to and from the facility which is used by research, extension and education faculty, community partners, and visitors.  Efforts put forth under this initiative ensures adequate safety of users, durability of vehicles and other equipment traveling on the access road to protect lives.  \r\n\r\n1890 Facilities Grant Proposal (FY 2017):\r\n\r\nThe Institution established and equipped two new greenhouses that support research and extension activities, installed a 40x40 square foot shade house adjacent to the greenhouses, and purchased and installed three high tunnels in the field near the greenhouse area.\r\n\r\nEnhancement of Teaching, Research and Extension Facilities \u2013 2017:\r\n\r\nFunds were used to continue with the construction of a Complex for Urban and Sustainable Agriculture, Food, Education and Research Building and the establishment of a Community Garden and Student Farm.  Both initiatives will be engaged in education, research, extension, and community outreach activities.  The focal point will be sustainable agriculture and urban, local, and community food systems education for producers, consumers, and students.  \r\n\r\nFacilities Grant Program \u2013 FY 2017:\r\n\r\nFacilities funds were used to: \r\n1) complete the relocation of an Agricultural and Environmental Research Station to the newly identified and improved site (former rehabilitation center); \r\n2 finalize the renovation of the F.

NIFA decided not to participate in the European Research Area Net (ERA-NET) Solicitation as instructed by the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n(O) National Robotics Initiative:\r\n\r\nRAPID: ROBOT-ASSISTED PRECISION IRRIGATION DELIVERY\r\nThis project will investigate a co-robotic approach where a team of humans and robots move through fields to adjust low-cost adjustable drip irrigation emitters at the plant level. The project will involve the design, development, and evaluation of a series of prototypes of low-cost, robust co-robotic systems compatible with existing drip irrigation infrastructure in vineyards and orchards. The project will build on prior work in irrigation modeling and develop feedback algorithms compatible with available sensing technologies using diffusion models to optimize desired emitter settings. The project will also extend results in Orienteering Planning to advise humans and guide robots about when, where, and how to act to achieve desired field conditions at the plant level.\r\n\r\nPRECISION POLLINATION ROBOT\r\nIn this project, a multi-disciplinary team of researchers propose to develop a prototype of precision pollination robot for bramble (e.g. blackberry and raspberry) pollination in a greenhouse environment. Computer vision algorithms will be used to estimate the flower position, size, orientation, and physical condition, and to guide the robotic arm to capture and interact with flowers. A set of soft brush tips, mimicking bee\u2019s hairs (i.e. scopa) and motion, will then be used to pollinate flowers. The design parameters of the delicate robot-flower interface will be driven by a series of insect pollination experiments. The precision rover navigation, mapping, and localization of individual flowers within complex greenhouse environments will be provided through a fusion of GPS, Lidar, camera, inertial sensor, and wheel encoder measurements. A human operator collaborates with the robot through supplying agriculture domain knowledge, providing high-level decisions, and correcting mistakes made by the robot\r\n\r\nROBOT-ASSISTED FIELD-BASED HIGH THROUGHPUT PLANT PHENOTYPING\r\nHigh-throughput phenotyping technologies that can quickly and repeatedly scan tens of thousands of individuals using an array of advanced sensor and data analytics tools are critical to improving the ability of scientists to dissect the genetics of quantitative traits such as yield and stress tolerance. The proposed project, to develop a robot-assisted field-based high throughput phenotyping system that integrates both ground and unmanned aerial elements to quantitatively measure a suite of key traits iteratively throughout the growing season, is expected to unmask plant responses that will inform a new level and quality of decision making in selection of crop genotypes for specific production conditions. The task coordination between ground and aerial vehicles will result in new discoveries in the area of partitioning and coverage control. Employing the proposed high throughput phenotyping system to acquire data on an unprecedented scale could address challenges that are unique to improvement of cotton (the focal crop), as well as general constraints leading to improvement of most crops.\r\n\r\nSALIENCY-DRIVEN ROBOTIC NETWORK FOR SPATIO-TEMPORAL PLANT PHENOTYPING\r\nThe objective of this project is to build a network of ground robots that can collect multi-modal data in research farms for high throughput modular plant phenotyping. The robotic network will have the following capabilities:\r\n(i)\tNavigate in a farm to collect data with minimal human intervention during operation;\r\n(ii)\tAutonomous decision making i.e, it can take its own decisions for maximizing the value of information of the acquired data;\r\n(iii)\tScalable in terms of the size of the farmland; and\r\n(iv)\tWork in collaboration with humans to improve their situational awareness in multi-dimensional genome wide studies. The approach will leverage opportunistic sensing, task partitioning and scout-task allocation and spatio-temporal importance map building, to enable resolution of the above science questions that cannot be addressed without the use of robotic systems.\r\n\r\nAT THE WATER\u2019S EDGE \u2013 INSTALLATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF ROBOTIC SENSING SYSTEMS\r\nWetlands are critical to the water cycle, yet they are a difficult environment to safely and effectively monitor. Robot systems have the potential to transform our understanding of complex wetlands systems by not only allowing faster and higher density sensing, but also by enabling new types of measurements and sample collections that cannot currently be performed without significantly disrupting these sensitive systems. This project proposes expanding current unmanned aerial vehicle systems, developing novel water monitoring systems, and designing algorithms in order to enable:\r\n(1) accurate measurement of the dynamic wetlands channels, including topography and flow, without prior knowledge;\r\n(2) adaptive and autonomous installation of static and limited-mobility sensors; and\r\n(3) optimization of the overall robot and sensor system to improve information gain while constrained by limited energy and communications.\r\n\r\n(P) NSF Cyber-Physical Systems:\r\n\r\nInformation is not yet available.

NIFA decided not to participate in the European Research Area Net (ERA-NET) Solicitation as instructed by the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n(O) National Robotics Initiative:\r\n\r\nRAPID: ROBOT-ASSISTED PRECISION IRRIGATION DELIVERY\r\nThis project will investigate a co-robotic approach where a team of humans and robots move through fields to adjust low-cost adjustable drip irrigation emitters at the plant level. The project will involve the design, development, and evaluation of a series of prototypes of low-cost, robust co-robotic systems compatible with existing drip irrigation infrastructure in vineyards and orchards. The project will build on prior work in irrigation modeling and develop feedback algorithms compatible with available sensing technologies using diffusion models to optimize desired emitter settings. The project will also extend results in Orienteering Planning to advise humans and guide robots about when, where, and how to act to achieve desired field conditions at the plant level.\r\n\r\nPRECISION POLLINATION ROBOT\r\nIn this project, a multi-disciplinary team of researchers propose to develop a prototype of precision pollination robot for bramble (e.g. blackberry and raspberry) pollination in a greenhouse environment. Computer vision algorithms will be used to estimate the flower position, size, orientation, and physical condition, and to guide the robotic arm to capture and interact with flowers. A set of soft brush tips, mimicking bee\u2019s hairs (i.e. scopa) and motion, will then be used to pollinate flowers. The design parameters of the delicate robot-flower interface will be driven by a series of insect pollination experiments. The precision rover navigation, mapping, and localization of individual flowers within complex greenhouse environments will be provided through a fusion of GPS, Lidar, camera, inertial sensor, and wheel encoder measurements. A human operator collaborates with the robot through supplying agriculture domain knowledge, providing high-level decisions, and correcting mistakes made by the robot\r\n\r\nROBOT-ASSISTED FIELD-BASED HIGH THROUGHPUT PLANT PHENOTYPING\r\nHigh-throughput phenotyping technologies that can quickly and repeatedly scan tens of thousands of individuals using an array of advanced sensor and data analytics tools are critical to improving the ability of scientists to dissect the genetics of quantitative traits such as yield and stress tolerance. The proposed project, to develop a robot-assisted field-based high throughput phenotyping system that integrates both ground and unmanned aerial elements to quantitatively measure a suite of key traits iteratively throughout the growing season, is expected to unmask plant responses that will inform a new level and quality of decision making in selection of crop genotypes for specific production conditions. The task coordination between ground and aerial vehicles will result in new discoveries in the area of partitioning and coverage control. Employing the proposed high throughput phenotyping system to acquire data on an unprecedented scale could address challenges that are unique to improvement of cotton (the focal crop), as well as general constraints leading to improvement of most crops.\r\n\r\nSALIENCY-DRIVEN ROBOTIC NETWORK FOR SPATIO-TEMPORAL PLANT PHENOTYPING\r\nThe objective of this project is to build a network of ground robots that can collect multi-modal data in research farms for high throughput modular plant phenotyping. The robotic network will have the following capabilities:\r\n(i)\tNavigate in a farm to collect data with minimal human intervention during operation;\r\n(ii)\tAutonomous decision making i.e, it can take its own decisions for maximizing the value of information of the acquired data;\r\n(iii)\tScalable in terms of the size of the farmland; and\r\n(iv)\tWork in collaboration with humans to improve their situational awareness in multi-dimensional genome wide studies. The approach will leverage opportunistic sensing, task partitioning and scout-task allocation and spatio-temporal importance map building, to enable resolution of the above science questions that cannot be addressed without the use of robotic systems.\r\n\r\nAT THE WATER\u2019S EDGE \u2013 INSTALLATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF ROBOTIC SENSING SYSTEMS\r\nWetlands are critical to the water cycle, yet they are a difficult environment to safely and effectively monitor. Robot systems have the potential to transform our understanding of complex wetlands systems by not only allowing faster and higher density sensing, but also by enabling new types of measurements and sample collections that cannot currently be performed without significantly disrupting these sensitive systems. This project proposes expanding current unmanned aerial vehicle systems, developing novel water monitoring systems, and designing algorithms in order to enable:\r\n(1) accurate measurement of the dynamic wetlands channels, including topography and flow, without prior knowledge;\r\n(2) adaptive and autonomous installation of static and limited-mobility sensors; and\r\n(3) optimization of the overall robot and sensor system to improve information gain while constrained by limited energy and communications.\r\n\r\n(P) NSF Cyber-Physical Systems:\r\n\r\nInformation is not yet available.

NIFA decided not to participate in the European Research Area Net (ERA-NET) Solicitation as instructed by the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n(O) National Robotics Initiative:\r\n\r\nRAPID: ROBOT-ASSISTED PRECISION IRRIGATION DELIVERY\r\nThis project will investigate a co-robotic approach where a team of humans and robots move through fields to adjust low-cost adjustable drip irrigation emitters at the plant level. The project will involve the design, development, and evaluation of a series of prototypes of low-cost, robust co-robotic systems compatible with existing drip irrigation infrastructure in vineyards and orchards. The project will build on prior work in irrigation modeling and develop feedback algorithms compatible with available sensing technologies using diffusion models to optimize desired emitter settings. The project will also extend results in Orienteering Planning to advise humans and guide robots about when, where, and how to act to achieve desired field conditions at the plant level.\r\n\r\nPRECISION POLLINATION ROBOT\r\nIn this project, a multi-disciplinary team of researchers propose to develop a prototype of precision pollination robot for bramble (e.g. blackberry and raspberry) pollination in a greenhouse environment. Computer vision algorithms will be used to estimate the flower position, size, orientation, and physical condition, and to guide the robotic arm to capture and interact with flowers. A set of soft brush tips, mimicking bee\u2019s hairs (i.e. scopa) and motion, will then be used to pollinate flowers. The design parameters of the delicate robot-flower interface will be driven by a series of insect pollination experiments. The precision rover navigation, mapping, and localization of individual flowers within complex greenhouse environments will be provided through a fusion of GPS, Lidar, camera, inertial sensor, and wheel encoder measurements. A human operator collaborates with the robot through supplying agriculture domain knowledge, providing high-level decisions, and correcting mistakes made by the robot\r\n\r\nROBOT-ASSISTED FIELD-BASED HIGH THROUGHPUT PLANT PHENOTYPING\r\nHigh-throughput phenotyping technologies that can quickly and repeatedly scan tens of thousands of individuals using an array of advanced sensor and data analytics tools are critical to improving the ability of scientists to dissect the genetics of quantitative traits such as yield and stress tolerance. The proposed project, to develop a robot-assisted field-based high throughput phenotyping system that integrates both ground and unmanned aerial elements to quantitatively measure a suite of key traits iteratively throughout the growing season, is expected to unmask plant responses that will inform a new level and quality of decision making in selection of crop genotypes for specific production conditions. The task coordination between ground and aerial vehicles will result in new discoveries in the area of partitioning and coverage control. Employing the proposed high throughput phenotyping system to acquire data on an unprecedented scale could address challenges that are unique to improvement of cotton (the focal crop), as well as general constraints leading to improvement of most crops.\r\n\r\nSALIENCY-DRIVEN ROBOTIC NETWORK FOR SPATIO-TEMPORAL PLANT PHENOTYPING\r\nThe objective of this project is to build a network of ground robots that can collect multi-modal data in research farms for high throughput modular plant phenotyping. The robotic network will have the following capabilities:\r\n(i)\tNavigate in a farm to collect data with minimal human intervention during operation;\r\n(ii)\tAutonomous decision making i.e, it can take its own decisions for maximizing the value of information of the acquired data;\r\n(iii)\tScalable in terms of the size of the farmland; and\r\n(iv)\tWork in collaboration with humans to improve their situational awareness in multi-dimensional genome wide studies. The approach will leverage opportunistic sensing, task partitioning and scout-task allocation and spatio-temporal importance map building, to enable resolution of the above science questions that cannot be addressed without the use of robotic systems.\r\n\r\nAT THE WATER\u2019S EDGE \u2013 INSTALLATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF ROBOTIC SENSING SYSTEMS\r\nWetlands are critical to the water cycle, yet they are a difficult environment to safely and effectively monitor. Robot systems have the potential to transform our understanding of complex wetlands systems by not only allowing faster and higher density sensing, but also by enabling new types of measurements and sample collections that cannot currently be performed without significantly disrupting these sensitive systems. This project proposes expanding current unmanned aerial vehicle systems, developing novel water monitoring systems, and designing algorithms in order to enable:\r\n(1) accurate measurement of the dynamic wetlands channels, including topography and flow, without prior knowledge;\r\n(2) adaptive and autonomous installation of static and limited-mobility sensors; and\r\n(3) optimization of the overall robot and sensor system to improve information gain while constrained by limited energy and communications.\r\n\r\n(P) NSF Cyber-Physical Systems:\r\n\r\nInformation is not yet available.
