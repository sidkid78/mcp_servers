- **Rationale:** High-frequency trading opportunities identified in volatility transitions
- **Technology Stack:** Apache Kafka + Apache Flink for real-time processing

### 3. Machine Learning Pipeline

- **Recommendation:** Implement predictive models for volatility regime detection
- **Rationale:** Clear patterns identified between market regimes and performance
- **Approach:** Ensemble methods combining technical indicators with market sentiment

### 4. Data Quality Monitoring

- **Recommendation:** Implement automated data quality checks
- **Current Status:** 100% data completeness achieved
- **Enhancement:** Real-time anomaly detection for data integrity

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Data Latency Risk:** Market conditions change rapidly during high volatility
   - **Mitigation:** Sub-100ms data pipeline implementation
   
2. **System Overload Risk:** Volume spikes can overwhelm processing capacity
   - **Mitigation:** Auto-scaling infrastructure with 3x capacity headroom

3. **Model Drift Risk:** Market regime changes may invalidate historical patterns
   - **Mitigation:** Continuous model retraining with drift detection
