# üêõ Bug Fix Summary for Project Management MCP Server

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Duration Mismatch Bug** 
**File:** `src/prompts/project_kickoff.py`
**Functions:** `_calculate_initial_estimates()` and `_suggest_project_phases()`

**Problem:** Two different calculations create inconsistent durations:
- Initial estimates: 14 weeks
- Phase total: 12 weeks

**Fix:** 
- Calculate phases first, then base estimates on phase totals
- OR calculate estimates first and scale phases to match

### 2. **Project Classification Bug**
**File:** `src/prompts/project_kickoff.py`
**Function:** `_classify_project()`

**Problem:** Simple keyword matching incorrectly classifies projects
- "Customer Feedback Portal" ‚Üí "Data Science" (wrong)
- Should be "Software Development"

**Fix:** 
- Use weighted scoring system
- Primary vs secondary keywords
- Better default fallback logic

### 3. **Stakeholder Coverage Bug**
**File:** `src/prompts/project_kickoff.py`
**Function:** `_analyze_stakeholders()`

**Problem:** Coverage score calculation flawed
- Only counts categories with stakeholders √ó 25
- Ignores actual stakeholder quality/quantity

**Fix:**
- Calculate percentage of required categories filled
- Add bonus for extra categories
- Improve coverage scoring logic

## Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Duration Consistency
In `project_kickoff_prompt()` function, change the order:

```python
# OLD (broken):
suggested_phases = await _suggest_project_phases(project_classification)
initial_estimates = await _calculate_initial_estimates(scope_analysis, project_classification)

# NEW (fixed):
temp_estimates = await _calculate_initial_estimates(scope_analysis, project_classification)
suggested_phases = await _suggest_project_phases(project_classification, temp_estimates["duration_weeks"])
initial_estimates = await _calculate_initial_estimates(scope_analysis, project_classification, suggested_phases)
```

### Fix 2: Better Project Classification
Replace the `_classify_project()` function with weighted scoring (see artifact).

### Fix 3: Fixed Stakeholder Coverage
Replace the coverage calculation in `_analyze_stakeholders()`:

```python
# OLD (broken):
coverage_score = sum(1 for cat in categorized.values() if cat) * 25

# NEW (fixed):
required_categories = _get_required_categories(project_type)
coverage_components = []
for category in required_categories:
    if categorized[category]:
        coverage_components.append(100)
    else:
        coverage_components.append(0)

coverage_score = sum(coverage_components) // len(required_categories) if required_categories else 0
```

## Testing the Fixes

Run this test to verify the fixes work:

```python
# Test the fixed functions
test_result = await project_kickoff_prompt_fixed(
    "Customer Feedback Portal Rollout",
    "Build a web-based tool for collecting and analyzing customer feedback",
    "Product Manager, UX Designer, Backend Engineer, Frontend Engineer"
)
print(test_result)
```

Expected improvements:
- ‚úÖ Consistent duration across estimates and phases
- ‚úÖ Correct project type classification (Software Development)
- ‚úÖ Higher stakeholder coverage score (75-100%)

## Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY** - These bugs affect core functionality and user trust in the system output.
