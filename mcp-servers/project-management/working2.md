Excellent! I've completed the balanced resource optimization for your E-commerce Platform project. Here's the comprehensive analysis and optimized assignments:

📊 Resource Optimization Summary
Overall Team Utilization
Total Team Capacity: 185 hours
Currently Assigned: 64 hours
Team Utilization Rate: 34.6%
Remaining Capacity: 121 hours available
👥 Optimized Task Assignments
Core Team Member Assignments
Team Member	Assigned Tasks	Hours	Utilization	Remaining Capacity
Alice Johnson	Requirements Analysis, Testing	16 hrs	40%	24 hrs available
Bob Smith	System Design, Deployment	16 hrs	40%	24 hrs available
Carol Davis	Database Design, Frontend Development	16 hrs	40%	24 hrs available
David Wilson	Backend Development	8 hrs	23%	27 hrs available
Eva Brown	API Integration	8 hrs	27%	22 hrs available
🔧 Recommended Resource Reallocation
Based on the actual team composition (CTO, Product Manager, Dev Team), here's the optimized assignment strategy:

Phase 1: Planning & Requirements (Week 1-2)
Product Manager → Requirements Analysis, Stakeholder Management CTO → System Design, Technical Architecture Dev Team → Technology research, environment setup

Phase 2: Design & Development (Week 3-8)
CTO → Database Design oversight, Code reviews Senior Developer → Backend Development (Core APIs) Mid-level Developer → Frontend Development (Web interface)
Junior Developer → Mobile app development, API integration

Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Week 9-10)
Product Manager → User Acceptance Testing coordination CTO → Performance optimization, Security review Dev Team → Integration testing, Bug fixes

Phase 4: Deployment (Week 11)
CTO → Deployment oversight, Infrastructure Senior Developer → Production deployment Product Manager → Go-live coordination

⚠️ Critical Resource Conflicts Identified
Skill Mismatch Issues
The analysis revealed several medium-severity skill mismatches across all assignments. Here are the recommended adjustments:

Requirements Analysis
Current: Alice Johnson (0% skill match)
Recommended: Product Manager (Business Analysis expertise)
System Design
Current: Bob Smith (0% skill match)
Recommended: CTO (System Architecture expertise)
Backend Development
Current: David Wilson (0% skill match)
Recommended: Senior Developer with Backend expertise
Database Design
Current: Carol Davis (0% skill match)
Recommended: CTO or Database specialist
🚀 Optimization Opportunities
1. Parallel Task Execution
Frontend Development can start after System Design (9 days float available)
Mobile Development can run parallel with Web Frontend
API Documentation can be created during Backend Development
2. Resource Load Balancing
Current utilization shows significant underutilization:

All team members are below 50% capacity
65% of total team capacity remains available
Opportunity to accelerate timeline or add scope
3. Skill Development Strategy
Cross-training opportunities:

Junior developers can shadow senior developers on complex tasks
Product Manager can learn technical review processes
QA processes can be distributed across team members
📈 Performance Optimization Recommendations
Immediate Actions
Reassign tasks based on actual skill sets
Define clear skill profiles for each team member
Set up mentoring pairs for knowledge transfer
Create backup assignments for critical path tasks
Capacity Management
Utilize remaining 121 hours for:
Additional feature development
Comprehensive documentation
Enhanced testing coverage
Performance optimization
Risk Mitigation:
Assign backup resources to critical path tasks
